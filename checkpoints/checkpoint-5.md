# Checkpoint 5

Here are the goals for this checkpoint:

* [ ] In the App component methods, add functions (as many helper functions as you find reasonable) to implement a timer using setInterval
* [ ] Start the timer when the start button is clicked
* [ ] Stop the timer when the timer runs out (hits 0)
