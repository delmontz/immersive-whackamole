# Checkpoint 2

Here are the goals for this checkpoint:

* [ ] Create the Mole component
* [ ] Use the Mole component inside of the Moles component. [Hint] Review the last checkpoint’s:
  * [ ] Review the `import` syntax
  * [ ] Review the `components` VueJS property
* [ ] Change the v-for loop in Moles to render 4 Mole components
* [ ] Dynamically render the mole state (active or inactive) onto the DOM as plain text
  * [ ] **[Hint]** you will need to use `props` and `v-bind` pass down information into the Mole component.
  * [ ] Confirm this by changing the data array in the App component and saving the App component file.
  * [ ] No need to get the Mole popping in and out yet. We’ll do this later!
