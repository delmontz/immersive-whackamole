# Checkpoint 4

You'll notice that the instructions for the checkpoint becomes less precise. We want you to make sure you are also practicing the skill of taking vague human requirements, and turning them into actionable steps for a programmer to commit some code.

Here are the goals for this checkpoint:

* [ ] Upon a click on a mole, manipulate the App data to increment the whack count
* [ ] Create a Counter component
* [ ] Render the Counter component in the App, passing down the whack count as props
* [ ] Render the other counters as well (passing their respective data down as props)
  * [ ] Confirm they are all working by changing the app data manually
